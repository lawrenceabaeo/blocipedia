## What is it?
* A Wikipedia-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web dev skills. 

* Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitignore a well.
